      <p>Come one, come all to the one and only Cleaver Brothers Carnival! Once the most popular touring carnival, their feats of death-defying showmanship were among the most spectacular acts seen in the business. People would come from all over to experience the spectacle that had become associated with the Cleaver family name. The wildest of imaginations was the birthplace for their carnival attractions and at the heart of it all were the famous Cleaver Clowns. </p><br/>

<p>These weren&#39;t your everyday circus clowns, though. Sure, they had all the usual clown tricks up their sleeves but these clowns always strived to find the most cutting-edge methods to entertain the masses. As time went on, though, it became increasingly difficult to get reactions out of the ever-expectant guests. The clowns became more and more frustrated until one evening, having had enough of the boos and taunts, the clowns decided to live up to the Cleaver Bros. name and take the term &#34;cutting-edge&#34; a little more literally. </p><br/>

<p>The clowns of Cleaver Bros. Carnival had finally found a way to give guests of all ages a smile that would never fade. Why have a razor-sharp whit when a sharp razor could be just as effective to permanently cut smiles across the faces of kids and adults alike? Suddenly the clowns had found a routine that was to DIE for and they simply couldn&#39;t get enough of seeing those ruby red smiles. The Cleaver Bros. Carnival is once again redefining the industry and it&#39;s a BLOODY good time.
