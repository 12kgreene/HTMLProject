      <p>The great machine had been created with one purpose &#45; to create a never ending supply of power. As the machine turned on for the first time, no one could guess that their lives would never be the same. The power supplied was so great that a tear was opened between our reality and a parallel universe. The rip in time pulled the machine and all of those around it into a void where nothing was as it seemed. The year was 1907 and the missing scientists were never heard from again.</p><br/>

<p>It has been described as living in a dream where you can&#39;t wake up. A void somewhere between what we know is real and a nightmare. The machine did as it was designed and produced more power than could ever be used. The 29 men and women that were pulled into the void awoke changed. Childhood injuries were gone but medical science was not the cure&#8230; the machine healed those that took the unplanned journey. Mechanical gears and pulleys took the palace of injured flesh creating a hybrid human. </p><br/>

<p>The small group of survivors were forced to create a civilization in a world that no one could have dreamed of. They were surrounded by the unknown and used the technology that had brought them to this new place to create a new life. They soon learned that they were not alone. Their arrival had started a chain of events that would eventually lead them into war against what could only be described as creatures from the deepest recesses of your nightmares.</p><br/>

<p>Welcome to the future &#45; the revolution has begun.
