      <p>The Reaper Township in Dominion County was always very proud of their crop of corn. The town&#39;s people gave great care to the crop to ensure the most delicious yielding crop possible. Tourists came from miles around to take in the sites, have a taste of the different types of corn dishes like the corn chowders, grilled corn and sweet corns, and travel the corn mazes.</p><br/> 

<p>Unfortunately their luck ran out.</p><br/>

<p>The corn crop began to wither and die. The corn tasted mealy and rotten and lost all value. The town&#39;s people, distraught and desperate to hold on to their livelihood, tried many different things to bring back the crop. </p><br/>

<p>Desperation can make people do crazy things&#8230;</p><br/>

<p>No one really knows how or why it was discovered that blood itself would bring the crop back, but it did. It&#39;s possible that the annual slaughtering of the pigs caused it. People began throwing the entrails and leftover parts of the animal carcasses into what was then considered the compost of their happy field. That was also about the time of the mysterious disappearances&#8230;and the appearance of the scarecrows.</p><br/>

<p>In any case, the town&#39;s people began to understand what the corn needed&#8230;
what it wanted.</p><br/>

<p>Blood.</p><br/>

<p>The people knew that in order to regain their lost pride and wealth they would have to take the necessary steps.</p><br/>

<p>They began using their children as sacrifices. And it worked. The corn grew, and began to warp over time. It became something alive. </p><br/>
<p>
Something&#8230;sinister.
