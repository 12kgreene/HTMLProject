      <h1>
      The following notes are the final entries found in the Journal of Dr. Roy Clifford. While on expedition to study the Kuzuri Clan and the effects of the encroaching modern world, Dr. Clifford and his party disappeared. No other trace of them has ever been found.</h1> <br/>

<h2><b>Dr. Clifford Journal entry 4; September 6th</b></h2> 
<p><i>It has been a long four days on the road but I am getting closer to my goal of studying the Kuruzi Clan and their traditions of Cannibalism. Today I met up with the guide who will take me deeper into the jungle and eventually to the Kuruzi Clan. A former member himself my guide did as many young members are doing and abandoned the clan and it&#39;s rituals to live in a more modernized life. Tomorrow we start the long journey upstream. My nerves rise as I think back to the stories of those that have gone before me into the area. Some have done it with success and others have never been heard from again. </i></p><br/>

<h2><b>Dr. Clifford Journal entry 7; September 9th</b></h2>
<p><i>Earlier today we reached our landing and will be staying the night with a sister clan of the Kuruzi. Our travels were mostly smooth despite my guide&#39;s trepidation about coming this far north. After my guide told them we come in peace they begrudgingly let us pass. Upon close inspection I could see that the tips of the arrows were barbed and deadly.</i></p><br/>

<h2><b>Dr. Clifford Journal entry 12; September 14th </b></h2>
<p><i>Our time in the sister Kuruzi village was very educational. My first night was unnerving as I tried to relax enough to sleep. Despite my trepidations the people treated us well and shared much with us.  Each night the tribe spends time sharing their stories with us. One that has caught my curiosity is the clan&#39;s belief in witches; they tell strange tales of Khakhura witches- people of the village who &#34;
shake and laugh evil laughs&#34;. They seem to be very afraid of these people and speak of them only in whispers.  The belief is that if a Khakhura gets to a member they become one themselves. Very strange and not anything I have heard of in my prior studies of the Clan. I will have to learn more about this.</i></p><br/>

<h2><b>Dr. Clifford Journal Entry 15; September 17th</b></h2> 
<p><i>We have been hiking deeper into the woods for days now with no sign of other clans just dilapidated villages. My anxieties are rising as I can tell my guide feels something is wrong. He won&#39;t say as much but his demeanor has changed and he is stepping more lightly than he was before.</i></p><br/>

<h2><b>Dr. Clifford Journal Entry 17; September 19th</b></h2> 
<p><i>We reached our destination today of the Kuruzi village. My guide says it is a much changed place. The people walk as if in fear and no one comes out after dark. No one will speak to us of why this is. Upon inquiry they shush us and send us to our hut if they will even speak to us at all. My guide refuses to say the name Khakhura and has ignored my pleas to ask the villagers about it. We are at odds because he says we need to pack up and leave soon but I have not come this far to abandon my study. There are strange noises in the night here that I did not notice in the other village; they are shrill enough to send shivers down your spine. Perhaps we should set out again soon.</i>
