      <p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  &#45;
 George Santayana</p><br/>

<p>Doswell Asylum No. 4 was once at the forefront of mental health care. It spent decades improving the lives of its patients. It pioneered medical advances that became the national standard for treatments.</p><br/>

<p>Sadly, those days are gone.</p><br/>

<p>The doctors at this once thriving center for mental health did the only thing they could to help their patients. They resorted to more traditional methods of treatment &#45;
methods that can hurt more than they help.</p><br/>

<p>Complete Isolation. Hydrotherapy. Lobotomies.</p><br/>

<p>As the patients got worse, so did the staff. They used their new treatments to justify unspeakable horrors. The doctors began to experiment on the people they swore to help. It started off small&#8230; and slowly the &#39;treatments&#39; began to turn their patients into monsters. </p><br/>
<p>What happens when you take the best parts of the worst people and use them to create a new person &#45; there is only one way to find out.</p><br/>

<p>Can you find your way out of bedlam? Can you survive this maze of madness?</p>
