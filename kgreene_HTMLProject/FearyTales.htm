      <p>What happens when dreams and reality collide?</p><br/>

<p>Were the characters of our childhood really as innocent and sweet as they were described?</p><br/>

<p>The truth is not something that you will take lightly. For centuries, children the world over have wished that these characters were real&#8230; unfortunately their wishes came true. Dragged out of the imaginary world that they once inhabited, the characters were finally free to be themselves. No longer forced to play their &#39;parts&#39;, they decided to show the world what they were made of. </p><br/>

<p>Once you have been forced to be nice, you may have an urge to do things your way. You want to break all of the rules. You want to see how much you can get away with. You want to make people hurt. You want to be yourself&#8230; no matter how sick and sinister you are.</p><br/>

<p>Welcome to the twisted world of former fairy tale &#39;victims&#39;. If you are lucky, you might make it out alive.
