      <h1></h1>
      <p>October 17, 1986 started like any other fall day at Lake Charles High School &#45;the football team was getting ready for their annual game against the Panthers and everyone was eagerly awaiting the homecoming dance. I wish I could tell you that the beavers were triumphant&#8230; I wish I could tell you that the dance was wicked. Unfortunately I can&#39;t.</p><br/>

<p>Accidents happen. Granted some accidents are a little more serious than others. What started as a fairly simple experiment in the science lab went wrong &#45; in a very big way. No one was prepared for what happened next. The fumes quickly filled the school and every student and teacher dropped dead where they stood. It&#39;s a tragic event that never should have happened. Sadly this isn&#39;t where our little tale of misfortune ends. </p><br/>

<p>Sometimes the dead don&#39;t stay dead. Sometimes they come back to life. So here we are searching for food in our new home. The days of giggling cheerleaders and stern teachers has come to an end.</p><br/>

<p>All that is left is a never ending desire for food &#45; a craving for flesh&#8230;
