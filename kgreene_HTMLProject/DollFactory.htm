      <p>The Barlow Toy Company was once the top producer of high quality childhood trinkets. The Barlow name was known for its amazing creations and was renowned for some of the most beautiful dolls ever created. Its owner Nikolas Barlow worked tirelessly for years to ensure that the family business would thrive but competition from inexpensive offerings made his once great company obsolete.</p><br/>

<p>Nikolas spent his entire life working to create the stuff that kids dream about, so much time in fact that his factory became his world. He was devastated when he was forced to shut the doors for good. Nikolas spent countless hours walking through the now deserted factory and realized that he had ruined the livelihood of his former associates. Nikolas also came to the realization that the company that his family had spent their lives to create had also stolen his life from him. He never took time for himself&#8230; he never found love and didn&#39;t have the chance to form a family of his own. He was left with the sad realization that he was completely and utterly alone.</p><br/>

<p>It was in this moment of desperation that Nikolas decided to change his life. He had spent all of his time creating playthings for the world and the time had come to create a masterpiece that he could call his own. His moment of desperation had turned into an obsession&#8230; why try to find a woman that would never meet his standards when he could create his perfect wife.</p><br/>

<p>Nikolas was not able to achieve his goals alone though, so he took the family fortune and brought in a small group of workers that would help him achieve his masterpiece. The money that had been made selling dreams would in turn help him create his own. The Marionette Murderer was born and the new playthings rolling off of the production line were nowhere near perfect but each new &#39;Doll&#39; brought him one step closer to fulfilling his new obsession, one step closer to happiness.
