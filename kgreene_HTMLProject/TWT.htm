      <p>The Blue Ridge Parkway has always been famous for its lush landscapes and glorious mountain views, but unknown to friendly travelers, mysterious beings exist deep within the woods. If you ask someone from the mountains about the Sisters of the Blue Ridge they&#39;ll politely change the subject, but find the right mountain elder and there are many tales to be told.</p><br/>
<p>Historians will tell you that in 1865 the Fairchild girls were the most popular sisters in Virginia; as wealthy as they were beautiful and sought after by every man from miles around. But others will tell you that when the sisters threw a lavish party, many men went in but not all of them came out. Disappearances began occurring regularly around town and soon after, massive losses of livestock were reported by local farmers. As men continued to disappear and animals were continually slaughtered, behind closed doors the Fairchild sisters were rumored to be responsible. Though there was never any proof, it was believed that the Fairchild girls were experimenting with dark magic and using the local townsmen as test subjects. </p><br/>
<p>Though the disappearances eventually slowed, for decades after strange occurrences continued to surround the Fairchild girls.  Eventually, all who remembered the horrors of 1865 passed on and the stories became myth and legend. Enter, if you dare, the Tollway Terror and see if the rumors are true. Some say the sisters are buried side by side in the field behind their beloved country home, but others say they are still lurking in the woods&#8230; searching for their next victim.
