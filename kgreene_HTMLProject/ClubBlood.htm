      <p>Welcome to the hottest club in town&#8230; our DJ&#39;s will keep the music loud and leave you drained!</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter who you are or where you are from, everyone is the same when the music starts and the lights dim low. Club Blood is a place where people from all walks of life can put aside their differences and just be equals for a night. Hidden from the public eye, Club Blood is the only destination that folks are dying to get into.</p><br/>

<p>New management took over the joint, though, with a brand new, bloodless perspective on the idea of having a good time. Why not give these poor, lost souls something even better, a nightlife that goes on and on&#8230; for eternity. The new and improved Club Blood really knows how to get the blood flowing. The only requirement to keep this party rockin&#39; is to give all you&#39;ve got! Blood&#8230; soul&#8230; no longer needed to keep the party going FOREVER! </p><br/>

<p>As the party has raged, though, so has the demand for the blood and the staff at Club Blood will do whatever is necessary to keep their &#39;clients&#39; happy. Never has hitting the dance floor been such a draining experience (literally). The undead work endlessly to the music to keep your blood pumping&#8230; right out of your body. Enter Club Blood to have the experience of a life(less) time but beware, once you go in, there&#39;s no leaving this domain of the night. </p><br/>

<p>Be warned, while Club Blood is the best in nighttime entertainment, don&#39;t stray too far from the crowds. There are whispers of hidden chambers within the club that no one ever leaves.
