      <h1></h1>
      <p>For sixty two years, generations of men made their way to the outskirts of town and worked in the dimly lit corridors and bloody death rooms of Dominion Meat Works.  For sixty two years, fathers ritually passed down to their sons the secrets of how to best &#34;stick a pig.&#34;  For sixty two years they fought against their own primal nature and tried not to &#34;enjoy&#34; their work of committing unspeakable acts of violence and murder upon millions of innocent and defenseless pigs.  They succeeded for sixty two years&#8230; </p><br/>
<p>Finally, all of the killing and torture has taken its toll on the sanity of the butchers at Dominion Meat Works. The pigs have now become too boring.  Too predictable.  Not even smart enough to hide.  The crazed butchers have decided that it is time to make their work &#34;fun&#34; again. </p><br/>
<p>You are about to enter a place that you will wish did not exist; A place where your last breath is controlled by the twisted and insane.  How many ways are there to die?  Our butchers have decided to find the answer to that question.  Over the years, they have become very creative.</p><br/>    

<p>Have YOU been chosen to be their next little piggy?
