      <p>The Inn at Darkside Manor was once a luxurious resort destination in the countryside of Virginia. It was once the grandest vacation getaway for the very wealthy.</p>  
 
<p>The Inn was a successful and a popular destination until its downfall during the great depression. The Lambert family continued to run and manage the hotel despite their enormous financial losses. The staff decided with the rein of the family removed&#8230; the remaining staff could have the power and resources to continue operation under a new direction. They schemed the rights of the property to themselves and unfortunate accidents within the hotel claimed the lives of the Lambert family.</p><br/>

<p>Despite the efforts of the new owners, the Inn continued to fail and the remaining staff members were forced to resort to extreme measures in order to survive. They began to steal personal property from the guests which led to many conflicts. The decision was made to eliminate these occurring conflicts by killing the guests. The Inn survived many decades at the guests&#39; expense. The staffs demeanor became cold and without regret to the mass murdering of hundreds of unsuspecting visitors.</p><br/>

<p>As technologies were introduced, so were new and creative ways for generating revenue for the Inn and its depraved staff. The internet became the perfect way to generate the much needed income for the Inn. Why kill for the simple belongings that weary travelers had brought with them when there are twisted and depraved people that would pay obscene amounts of money to watch the staff kill innocent travelers. The Inn at Darkside Manor had finally found the perfect way to survive.
