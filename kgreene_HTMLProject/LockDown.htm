      <p>Once a model prisoner reform facility, Doswell State Penitentiary was renowned for its progressive educational programs that worked to better the lives of those incarcerated within the walls of the compound. Unfortunately, as the prisoner population continued to increase these opportunities became fewer and fewer until all of the programs were completely cancelled.</p><br/>

<p>Though it was designed for only 800 prisoners, at one point more than 1,500 inmates were forced to reside within the prison. Some say that this extreme overcrowding led to the event that forever marred the reputation of the region. More than half a century ago on a cold October night, it was an evening like any other until sounds of trouble began to emerge from deep within the prison. The Doswell riot claimed the lives of dozens of men that night, leaving them forever entombed within the walls of this institution.</p><br/>

<p>Following the massacre the prison was abandoned and left to crumble. Even to this day locals still claim to hear the horrific sounds of the failed uprising and the few that have made it onto the prison grounds report seeing shadowy figures roaming the cell blocks. Today the prison is finally being reopened and you&#39;re the first to get inside.  All visitors are encouraged to stay on the marked paths, or you may find yourself the next victim of this never-ending Lockdown.
