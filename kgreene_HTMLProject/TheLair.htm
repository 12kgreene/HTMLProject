      <p>They lived high in the mountains for centuries. The local villagers knew of their presence but they knew the creatures of darkness only took enough to survive. There were always outcries when a friend or relative disappeared but the elders silenced the few who complained.</p><br/>

<p>The woods to the east of the village were forbidden. There were rumors of an ancient castle deep in the forest but no one dared to find out if the rumors were true. Time passed and the unlikely balance was maintained. Unfortunately the peace was not to last.</p><br/>

<p>As the village grew the traditions of the old days were ignored. The village grew and expanded and the forest was slowly cut down to provide for the villagers. The safe haven was no longer able to protect the vampire clan. The vampires began to fight back and they were determined to keep their home. A war was waged&#8230;</p><br/>

<p>The vampires attacked the villagers but were not prepared for anyone to challenge them. The villagers were waiting for the vampire clan and were able to kill about half of the attacking vampires. Badly outnumbered and in fear for the survival of their clan the remaining vampires took the only option available to them&#8230; they left their homeland in search for a new home.</p><br/>

<p>The remaining vampires traveled from village to village in search of a new place to settle and rebuild. The search did not go as planned&#8230; after more than a decade of searching the vampires ravaged by hunger took refuge in a series of caves in a distant mountain range. Their food sources were scarce but safety was finally achieved.</p><br/>

<p>The remaining vampires lie in wait&#8230; searching for a new source of blood&#8230; searching for a way to reclaim all that was lost&#8230; laying in the dark searching for the sound of a simple heartbeat.
