      <h1></h1>
      <p>Built upon once-cursed land, the Mountain Grove Cemetery has overlooked the countryside for hundreds of years. For centuries, its graves have been filled with the bodies of those who befell tragic ends in life. It was with their dying breath that one of these victims cursed their killer. That night, an ancient, unknown power was reawakened. </p><br/>

<p>Each night, as the sky darkens and the moon rises, these victims of unspeakable violence buried in the cemetery have their corpses forcibly drug from their graves to avenge the untimely demise of their previous lives. Bound to this dominion of the dead, the corpses are forced to wander the grounds in search of the person who brought about their demise. With the rise of each new dawn, this dark power lifts and forces the corpses of the damned back to their graves to await the night and their next chance at vengeance.</p><br/>

<p>Unsuccessful in their attempts at retribution, the corpses will attack anyone who enters their hallowed grounds. The blind rage that motivates these corpses has helped create a nightmarish legend of fear and death. People haven&#39;t buried their loved-ones in the Mountain Grove Cemetery for decades, yet freshly dug graves seem to appear almost daily. To this day, the curse of the walking dead continues to claim more victims as the unsuspecting are dragged into the nightmare that is waiting in this Necropolis.
